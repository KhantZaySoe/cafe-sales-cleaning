# Cafe Sales Cleaning Project (Python & Pandas)

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a messy cafe sales dataset using Python and Pandas.  
The goal is to convert raw, dirty data into a clean and usable format for further analysis or reporting.

##  Project Overview

In real-world businesses, sales data often contains missing values, inconsistent formats, and errors.  
This project demonstrates how such data can be cleaned step by step using Python.

The final output is a cleaned CSV file that is ready for analysis, dashboards, or business decision-making.
